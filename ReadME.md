# MQTT Authentication Broker based on Token
___

 Designed and implemented an authentication broker that can defend authentication bypass due to MITM(man-in-the-middle-attack) attack, a vulnerability of MQTT protocol used in IoT environment. An attacker on the network has identified a possible damage to a user using an MQTT protocol device by subscribing to the individual's topic by issuing false messages of malicious sight and unauthorized authentication through authentication bypass in MQTT communication.
